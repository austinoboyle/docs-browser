### This should not work because it is not properly escaped
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]

### This should work because we escape the beginning and ending backslashes
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
\\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\\]
